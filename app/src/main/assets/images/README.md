# Sample 2D Images for Testing

Since I cannot create actual PNG files, here are some options to get your jewelry images:

## Quick Testing (Temporary Images):
1. **Download sample jewelry PNGs** from:
   - freepng.org (search "necklace png", "chain png") 
   - pngimg.com/jewelery
   - vecteezy.com (free with account)

2. **Use your existing jewelry photos**:
   - Take photos of your actual jewelry
   - Remove background using: remove.bg or photopea.com
   - Save as PNG with transparency

## For Your Real App:
- Photograph your actual jewelry pieces
- Use professional lighting
- Remove backgrounds to PNG
- Size them to 1024x1024 or larger

## File Placement:
Place your PNG files here:
- necklace: assets/images/necklace/necklace_main.png
- chain: assets/images/chain/chain_silver.png  
- ring: assets/images/ring/ring_gold.png

The app will automatically detect and use these images!
