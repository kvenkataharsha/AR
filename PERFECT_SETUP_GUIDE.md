# Perfect Asset Setup for Your Jewelry

## The Same Necklace - Two Formats:

### Option 1: Same Physical Jewelry
- 📸 **2D Photo**: Take a photo of your actual necklace (front view, transparent background)
- 🎯 **3D Model**: Your existing 11777_necklace_v1_l3.obj file
- ✅ **Result**: Realistic appearance with accurate sizing

### Option 2: Matching Design
- 📸 **2D Photo**: Professional jewelry photo (same style/design as your 3D model)
- 🎯 **3D Model**: Your existing 11777_necklace_v1_l3.obj file  
- ✅ **Result**: Consistent appearance and measurements

## File Structure:
```
assets/
├── images/necklace/
│   └── necklace_main.png          # Photo of YOUR actual necklace
└── models/necklace/
    ├── 11777_necklace_v1_l3.obj   # 3D model of SAME necklace
    ├── 11777_necklace_v1_l3.mtl   # Materials for 3D model
    └── Necklace_stone.jpg          # Texture for 3D model
```

## Why Both Are Needed:

### 2D Image Provides:
- ✨ Realistic visual appearance
- 🎨 Actual colors and materials  
- 💎 Real shine and reflections
- 📱 Fast mobile performance

### 3D Model Provides:
- 📏 Accurate dimensions for scaling
- 📍 Proper positioning data
- 🔢 Technical specifications
- 📊 Material information

## The App Uses Both:
1. **Reads 3D model** → Gets size/positioning data
2. **Displays 2D image** → Shows realistic appearance  
3. **Combines both** → Perfect positioning + realistic look!
